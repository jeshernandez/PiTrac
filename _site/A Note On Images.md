One note on images in the documentation.  We don't currently have a good pipeline to convert the documentation we're writing into markdown (.md) files with embedded images.  As a short term work-around for now, we're releasing the documentation in .rtf format--with embedded images--to make it easier for folks to download and view them.  We will add images inline into documents as we can.
