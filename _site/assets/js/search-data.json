    "content": "The PiTrac project is a fully-functional golf launch monitor that avoids the need for expensive high shutter-speed and high frame-rate cameras. Weâ€™ve developed techniques for high-speed, infrared, strobe-based image capture and processing using cameras such as the Pi Global Shutter camera (~US$50 retail) and Raspberry Pi single board computers. PiTrac determines ball speed, launch angles, and spin in 3 axes. Its output is accessible on a stand-alone web app. Interfaces to popular golf-course simulators including GsPro and E6 are working. 2k/TopGolf never responded to our requests.
