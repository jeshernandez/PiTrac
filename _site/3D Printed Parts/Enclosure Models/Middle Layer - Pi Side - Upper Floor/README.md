**Base Layer – Pi Side – Floor - Description:**

Please see the main Enclosure Assembly instructions in the Documentation folder for additional information on this part.

This is the lower-right-most floor portion of the PiTrac Launch Monitor. A [FreeCAD 1.0](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php) compatible parameterized model is included here along with .stl files. This part provides a floor to mount the Pi 2 computer component and the Camera 2. The floor mounts to the four screw holes near the middle of the Base Layer – Pi Side – Wall part.

The model is parameterized for ease of modifications, though the part is complex enough that any changes can sometimes lead to issues in FreeCAD. Modifiable parameters are in the “Master Document” spreadsheet, which is assumed to be in the directory immediately above wherever this part’s FreeCAD file exists.

**Printing Notes:**

Both PLA or PETG can work for this part. It is a fairly simple part to print successfully.

Recommended print settings: 3 perimeter layers), 15% infill, gyroid infill patterns, no supports (see Prusa Slicer .3mf file for details). Some JT16 Glu-Stick glue (or similar) is recommended to prevent pull-up and warping of the part if printing in PLA.
