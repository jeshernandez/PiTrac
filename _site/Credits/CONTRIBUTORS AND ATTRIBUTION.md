**CONTRIBUTORS AND ATTRIBUTION**

The PiTrac team is grateful for everyone who has authored, supported, maintained and hosted the open-source technology that the system uses.  PiTrac works using, in conjunction with, or at least inspired by the following projects and technologies.  We especially thank the individual developers of these great technologies for their contributions to the community.

1. [Active-MQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) (multi-protocol messaging middleware)  
2. Apache [Jakarta](https://jakarta.apache.org/) Server Pages (serves the web-based default system GUI)  
3. [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (various foundational libraries for logging, multi-threading, thread-safe data structures, command line processing, etc.)  
4.  [Debian](https://www.raspbian.org/) (Raspbian) Linux (OS)  
5. [ED\_Lib](https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib) (Edge detection)  
6. [fmtlib/fmt](https://fmt.dev/11.0/) (Formatting library that provides c++20 style formatting)  
7. [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php) (Parametric 3D CAD/CAM software)  
8. [JSON](https://github.com/google/gson) (serialization)  
9. [JMS](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-message-service.html#:~:text=The%20Java%20Message%20Service%20\(JMS,coupled%2C%20reliable%2C%20and%20asynchronous.) (messaging)  
10. [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) (schematic capture and PCB layout)  
11. [Libcamera](https://libcamera.org/) and [Libcamera/rpicam-apps](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpicam-apps) App (open-source camera stack & framework)  
12. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html) (java build automation)  
13. [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) & [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (build tools)  
14. [Msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) (efficient architecture-independent serialization)  
15. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (image processing & filtering, matrix math)  
16.  [libgpiod](https://github.com/brgl/libgpiod) (GPIO and SPI library)  
17. [Prusa MK4S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mk4s-3d-printer-kit/) and [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/)(3D Printer and Slicer)  
18. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) Single-Board Computers  
19. [Shedskin](https://shedskin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (Certain colorsys elements)  
20. [Tomee and other Apache products](https://tomee.apache.org/) (hosts the web-based interface)  
21. [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) (Schematic and PCB software)

We are also thankful for individual contributors who—even if we haven’t used their code—have answered questions and who have spent a lot of their time making groups such as the Raspberry Pi community a smarter, better place.  In particular,

1. [Hermann Stamm-Wilbrandt](https://stamm-wilbrandt.de/en/) (@HermannSW)  
2. Jake Hauck and jRhodes95 @ github  
3. Senior Principal Engineer Naushir Patuck and his colleagues at Raspberry Pi  
4. @Arnold Palmer, @mca312, @DJ, @Hank, @kallikarls and others at GSPro Country Club  
5. Professor Shingo W. Kagami, Ph.D., Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University

We would not have been able to create the golf simulator interfaces without the help of the following folks:

1. The very supportive GSPro business development people  
2. The folks at TruGolf, especially Melissa and Ryan.
